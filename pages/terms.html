            <p class="pb-2">Your mcqmed.lk membership will continue until terminated. To use the mcqmed.lk service you must have Internet access and a mcqmed.lk ready device, and provide mcqmed.lk with one or more Payment Methods. "Payment Method" means a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time, and which may include payment through your account with a third party. Unless you cancel your membership before your billing date, you authorize us to charge the membership fee for the next billing cycle to your Payment Method. <br/><br/>

            We may offer a number of membership plans, including memberships offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. Some membership plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. <br/><br/>

            We may from time to time offer special promotional offers, plans or memberships.

We may use information such as device ID, method of payment or an account email address used with an existing or recent mcqmed.lk membership to determine Offer eligibility. The eligibility requirements and other limitations and conditions will be disclosed when you sign-up for the offer or in other communications made available to you.</p>

            <h3><b>Billing and Cancellation</b></h3>
            <p class="pb-2">The membership fee for the mcqmed.lk service and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you signed-up for the service. In some cases your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it for up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register. If you signed up for mcqmed.lk using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find the billing information about your mcqmed.lk membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party.<br/><br/>

You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method.<br/><br/>
